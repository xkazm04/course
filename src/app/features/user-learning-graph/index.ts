/**
 * User Learning Graph Feature
 *
 * This feature transforms user decisions (path selection, node completion, skipping)
 * into mutations on a personal learning graph. The graph evolves over time,
 * tracking the user's learning journey and enabling personalized recommendations.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - User decisions are learning path mutations
 * - The system is a graph editor where users sculpt their curriculum
 * - Aggregated patterns reveal learning strategy preferences
