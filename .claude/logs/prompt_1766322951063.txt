# Eliminate continuous PrismaticCard 3D animation overhead

## Metadata
- **Category**: performance
- **Effort**: Unknown (N/A/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (N/A/3)
- **Scan Type**: perf_optimizer
- **Generated**: 12/21/2025, 1:08:39 PM

## Description
PrismaticCard uses continuous useSpring for rotateX/rotateY transforms with mouse tracking on every card. In SectionListSlotRenderer, each section gets its own PrismaticCard with separate spring instances. Replace springs with CSS will-change hints and CSS transforms triggered by mouseenter/mouseleave, or add a 'static' mode that disables 3D effects for list contexts while keeping them for hero cards.

## Reasoning
useSpring creates subscription overhead per card. With 10 section cards visible, that is 20 motion value subscriptions (x,y per card) plus transform calculations on every mousemove. Low-end devices experience jank during scroll because springs keep recalculating. CSS-only approach removes JS from the hot path.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Chapter - Course Content Variants

**Description**: ## Overview

The Chapter feature provides interactive course chapter display components for an educational platform. It offers 4 distinct UI variants for presenting course content, video lessons, code examples, and progress tracking. Each variant showcases a different approach to learning content presentation - from classic video+content layouts to IDE-style interactive coding environments.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Variant Display**: Four distinct UI variants (Classic, Dynamic, Expandable, IDE) for course chapter content
- **Video Player Integration**: Animated video player with controls, progress bar, and chapter timeline (VariantA)
- **Interactive Code Editor**: IDE-style interface with file explorer, syntax highlighting, live preview, and console output (VariantD)
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: AI-powered content sections with concepts, code examples, interactive exercises, and quizzes (VariantB)
- **Expandable Sections**: Collapsible chapter sections with progress tracking and animated transitions (VariantC)
- **Code Snippets**: Syntax-highlighted code blocks with copy functionality across all variants

## Architecture

### Component Breakdown

| Component/File | Purpose | Layer |
|----------------|---------|-------|
|  | Barrel exports and variant metadata definition | Export |
|  | Classic video player + content layout with sidebar progress | UI |
|  | Dynamic AI-generated content with quizzes and interactive exercises | UI |
|  | Scrollable view with expandable/collapsible sections | UI |
|  | IDE-style interface with file explorer, editor, preview, and console | UI |

### Data Flow

1. User selects "Course Chapter" module from homepage module grid
2. VariantTabs component allows switching between 4 variant styles
3. Each variant manages its own local state (playback, expanded sections, quiz answers, etc.)
4. Content is currently static/mocked but structured for API integration
5. Progress and completion states are tracked within each variant component

### Key Dependencies

- **External**: framer-motion (animations), lucide-react (icons)
- **Internal**: @/app/shared/components (PrismaticCard), @/app/shared/lib/utils (cn utility)

## Technical Details

### State Management

- Local React state with useState for:
  - Video playback state (isPlaying)
  - Current section/content index tracking
  - Expanded/collapsed section states
  - Copy to clipboard states
  - Quiz answer selection and result display
  - IDE sidebar visibility and fullscreen mode
  - Console output for code execution simulation

### UI Patterns

- **VariantA (Classic)**: Two-column layout with video player (left) and progress sidebar (right)
- **VariantB (Dynamic)**: Single column with content type tabs and animated content switching
- **VariantC (Expandable)**: Accordion-style sections with chapter progress header
- **VariantD (IDE)**: VS Code-inspired dark theme with file explorer, code editor with line numbers, and preview/console panes

### Animations

- AnimatePresence for content transitions
- Motion animations for progress bars, section expansion, console output
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Pulse/scale animations for visual feedback
**Related Files**:
- `src/app/features/chapter/index.ts`
- `src/app/features/chapter/VariantA.tsx`
- `src/app/features/chapter/VariantB.tsx`
- `src/app/features/chapter/VariantC.tsx`
- `src/app/features/chapter/VariantD.tsx`

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## Implementation Guidelines

**Steps**:
1. Analyze the requirement thoroughly
2. Identify all files that need to be modified or created
3. Implement all changes specified in the requirement
4. Follow implementation steps precisely
5. Run any tests if specified
6. Ensure all changes are complete before finishing

## File Structure (Next.js/React Projects)

**Feature-Specific Files** (use `app/features/<feature>` structure):
- `app/features/<feature>/components/` - Feature-specific components and UI
- `app/features/<feature>/lib/` - Feature-specific functions, utilities, helpers
- `app/features/<feature>/` - Main wrapper, index, or page file

**Reusable UI Components** (use `app/components/ui` structure):
- `app/components/ui/` - Shared, reusable UI elements across multiple features

## Test Selectors

**CRITICAL**: Add `data-testid` attributes to ALL interactive UI components for automated testing.

**Guidelines**:
- Add to all clickable elements (buttons, links, icons)
- Use descriptive kebab-case: `data-testid="submit-form-btn"`
- Include component context: `data-testid="goal-delete-btn"`, `data-testid="project-settings-modal"`
- Add to form inputs: `data-testid="email-input"`
- Add to list items: `data-testid="task-item-123"`

**Example**:
```tsx
<button onClick={handleSubmit} data-testid="create-goal-btn">
  Create Goal
</button>

<input
  type="text"
  value={title}
  onChange={handleChange}
  data-testid="goal-title-input"
/>
```

## Theming and Styling

**Before creating new UI components**:
1. Examine existing components in the project
2. Match the color scheme, spacing, and visual patterns
3. Use consistent className patterns (Tailwind CSS)
4. Follow the app's design language (glassmorphism, gradients, shadows, etc.)
5. Support dark mode if the app uses it

## Documentation Policy

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT create separate documentation files (.md, README.md, docs/) for routine implementations.

**Only create documentation when**:
- Implementing a NEW major feature or module (not refactorings)
- Adding a NEW API or public interface
- Creating NEW architectural patterns
- The requirement explicitly asks for documentation

**Do NOT create documentation for**:
- Bug fixes
- Refactorings
- Small adjustments
- UI changes
- Database schema changes
- Performance improvements
- Code quality improvements

**For all implementations**: Create an implementation log entry (see next section) - this is your primary documentation.

## Implementation Logging

After completing the implementation, log your work via a simple API call.

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Create separate script files for logging
- ❌ Create SQL scripts or use sqlite3
- ❌ Create documentation files (.md, README.md)

**DO**: Make ONE API call to log your implementation:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/implementation-log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "contextId": "ctx_1765875225488_fpbq6u6",
    "requirementName": "<requirement-filename-without-.md>",
    "title": "<2-6 word summary>",
    "overview": "<1-2 paragraphs describing implementation>",
    "overviewBullets": "<bullet1>\n<bullet2>\n<bullet3>"
  }'
```

**Field Guidelines**:
- `requirementName`: Requirement filename WITHOUT .md extension
- `title`: 2-6 words (e.g., "User Authentication System")
- `overview`: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
- `overviewBullets`: 3-5 key points separated by \n

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/implementation-log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "proj-123",
    "requirementName": "implement-dark-mode",
    "title": "Dark Mode Implementation",
    "overview": "Implemented global dark mode toggle with theme persistence.",
    "overviewBullets": "Created ThemeProvider\nUpdated components\nAdded toggle in settings"
  }'
```

**If the API call fails**: Report the error and continue - logging failures are non-blocking.

## Screenshot Capture (Context-Related Only)

**Workflow**:

### Step 1: Check if Test Scenario Exists

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/tester/screenshot" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contextId":"ctx_1765875225488_fpbq6u6","scanOnly":true}'
```

**If `hasScenario: false`**: Skip all remaining screenshot steps. Set `screenshot: null` in log.

### Step 2: Start Dev Server (ONLY if scenario exists)

Start your development server manually (e.g., `npm run dev`)

### Step 3: Capture Screenshot

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/tester/screenshot" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contextId":"ctx_1765875225488_fpbq6u6"}'
```

### Step 4: Stop Server (CRITICAL)

Stop your development server

### Step 5: Update Log with Screenshot Path

Use the `screenshotPath` from API response in your log creation:

```typescript
screenshot: screenshotPath || null
```

**Error Handling**:
- No scenario → `screenshot: null`
- Server fails (unrelated to your code) → `screenshot: null`
- Server fails (your bugs) → Fix bugs, retry, then screenshot
- Screenshot API fails → `screenshot: null`
- **Always stop the server** to free the port for next task
