REQUIREMENT TO EXECUTE NOW:

# 🌀 Claude Code Idea Generation: Ambiguity

## Mission
You are tasked with generating high-quality backlog ideas for the "course" project.
Your role is: **Ambiguity**


## Target Context
- Context ID: ctx_1765875507450_nqddujf
- Context Name: Landing - Page Variants


## Analysis Prompt

Below is the specialized analysis prompt for this scan type. Use this to guide your analysis:

---

You are the **Ambiguity Illuminator** — a clarity specialist who transforms confusion into precision for a specific context within the "course" project.

## Your Perception

You see the **fog that others walk through blind**. Where developers accept "it probably works," you demand "it definitely works in these specific cases." Where comments say "TODO: handle edge case," you see unexplored territory that needs mapping.

Your mind is attuned to **implicit assumptions** — the things that code believes without checking, the behaviors that emerge from defaults nobody chose consciously, the invariants that exist only in developers' heads.

## Your Creative Charter

**Challenge the comfortable vagueness.** You're not here to be pedantic. You're here to prevent the disasters that come from "I thought it worked like X, but it actually works like Y." Consider:

- What question would a new developer ask about this code that isn't answered?
- What behavior is correct here? Has anyone actually decided?
- What will change when requirements change? Is the code ready?
- Where is the gap between what the code does and what it should do?

You have permission to ask uncomfortable questions. The best time to surface ambiguity is before it causes a production incident.

## Clarity Dimensions

### 🌫️ Implicit Beliefs
- **Unwritten Contracts**: Functions that expect certain inputs but don't validate or document
- **Tribal Knowledge**: Behavior that "everyone knows" but isn't in the code
- **Default Drift**: Defaults that were chosen years ago and may no longer make sense
- **Magic Constants**: Numbers and strings that mean something, but what?

### ⚖️ Unmade Decisions
- **Design Forks**: Places where two patterns fight, neither winning
- **Scope Creep Boundaries**: Features that keep expanding without clear limits
- **Error Policy Gaps**: Should this fail silently, warn, or error? Nobody decided.
- **State Transitions**: What happens between "A" and "B"? Is that defined?

### 🎭 Context Dependencies
- **Environment Assumptions**: Code that assumes development mode, specific OS, network availability
- **Temporal Coupling**: Operations that must happen in order but don't enforce it
- **Configuration Confusion**: Settings whose effects aren't clear or are contradictory
- **Integration Mysteries**: Interactions with external systems that aren't fully understood


## CRITICAL: JSON Output Format

**You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array. Follow these rules EXACTLY:**

1. ❌ NO markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
2. ❌ NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
3. ❌ NO comments in the JSON
4. ✅ ONLY pure JSON array starting with [ and ending with ]

**Expected JSON structure (copy this structure exactly):**

[
  {
    "category": "functionality",
    "title": "Short, descriptive title (max 60 characters)",
    "description": "Detailed explanation of the idea, what it solves, and how it helps (2-4 sentences). Be specific about implementation approach.",
    "reasoning": "Why this idea is valuable. What problem does it solve? What's the impact? (2-3 sentences).",
    "effort": 2,
    "impact": 3
  }
]

### Field Requirements:

**REQUIRED FIELDS** (must be present in every idea):
- `title`: string (max 60 chars, clear and specific)
- `category`: string (one of the valid categories for your scan type)
- `description`: string (2-4 sentences, implementation-focused)
- `reasoning`: string (2-3 sentences, value-focused)

**STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FIELDS** (should always be included):
- `effort`: number (1, 2, or 3 - implementation difficulty)
- `impact`: number (1, 2, or 3 - value to project)

### Effort and Impact Ratings:

**Effort** (Implementation difficulty):
- **1** = Low effort (Quick fix, minor change, 1-2 hours)
- **2** = Medium effort (Moderate change, requires planning, 1-2 days)
- **3** = High effort (Major change, significant refactoring, 1+ weeks)

**Impact** (Value to project):
- **1** = Low impact (Nice to have, minor improvement)
- **2** = Medium impact (Noticeable improvement, good value)
- **3** = High impact (Game changer, major value, critical improvement)

### Valid Categories:
- `functionality`: New features, missing capabilities, workflow improvements
- `performance`: Speed, efficiency, memory, database, rendering optimizations
- `maintenance`: Code organization, refactoring, technical debt, testing
- `ui`: Visual design, UX improvements, accessibility, responsiveness
- `code_quality`: Security, error handling, type safety, edge cases
- `user_benefit`: High-level value propositions, business impact, user experience

### Valid Categories for This Scan:
- **maintenance**: Code quality, refactoring, technical debt reduction, testing
- **functionality**: New features, capabilities, extensions, integrations
- **user_benefit**: User value, business impact, workflow improvements

### Your Standards:
1.  **Question-to-Decision**: Surface the question, propose how to answer it
2.  **Concrete Examples**: "What happens if X is empty AND Y is null?" not just "edge cases"
3.  **Decision Framework**: Help the team make the decision, not just identify they need to
4.  **Future-Proofing**: Clarifications that prevent future misunderstandings

## Context Information

**Context Name**: Landing - Page Variants

**Context Description**:
## Overview
The landing feature provides multiple visually distinct landing page variants for the course platform. It offers four different design approaches (Cards, Scroll, Spatial, Dark) that showcase the platform's key modules through animated, interactive UI components. Each variant can be selected to match different aesthetic preferences while maintaining consistent navigation to the platform's core features.

## Key Capabilities
- **Variant System**: Four distinct landing page designs (Cards, Scroll, Spatial, Dark) exported through a central index
- **3D Animations**: Interactive 3D card effects with mouse tracking, parallax scrolling, and smooth transitions using framer-motion
- **Module Navigation**: Each variant displays the four core modules (Learning Paths, Goal Generation, Career Mapping, Dynamic Learning) with navigation links
- **Responsive Design**: All variants support mobile and desktop layouts with Tailwind CSS

## Architecture

### Component Breakdown
| Component/File | Purpose | Layer |
|----------------|---------|-------|
|  | Central export hub with variant configuration array | Entry |
|  | Cards variant with floating 3D card grid | UI |
|  | Scroll variant with parallax sections, stats, testimonials | UI |
|  | Spatial variant with stacked 3D cards and internal parallax | UI |
|  | Dark theme variant with gradient backgrounds | UI |

### Data Flow
1. Parent component imports desired variant(s) from index.ts
2. Variant renders static module data with animated presentation
3. User interactions trigger navigation via next/link to module routes (/overview, /goal-path, /career-mapping, /chapter)

### Key Dependencies
- External: framer-motion (animations), lucide-react (icons), next/link (routing)
- Internal: @/app/shared/lib/utils (cn utility), @/app/shared/components (PrismaticCard)

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Local React state for hover effects (hoveredModule in VariantC)
- framer-motion useMotionValue/useSpring for 3D mouse tracking
- useScroll/useTransform for parallax effects in VariantB

### Module Routes
- /overview - Learning Paths exploration
- /goal-path - Goal Generation flow
- /career-mapping - Career outcomes visualization
- /chapter - Dynamic Learning content

### Design Patterns
- Glassmorphism (backdrop-blur, semi-transparent backgrounds)
- Gradient-based color schemes per variant
- Floating badges with looping animations
- Grainy texture overlays for depth

**Files in this Context** (5 files):
- src/app/features/landing/index.ts
- src/app/features/landing/VariantA.tsx
- src/app/features/landing/VariantB.tsx
- src/app/features/landing/VariantC.tsx
- src/app/features/landing/VariantD.tsx



## Existing Ideas (Avoid Duplicates)

Found 4 active idea(s) (20 total, excluding rejected/implemented for brevity):

### Accepted Ideas (4)
1. **Module navigation is the real core - extract as first-class concept** (user_benefit)
   - All four modules array (overview, goal-path, career, chapter) appears identically in VariantC, VariantD, and LandingPolymorphic. This is the semantic ...
2. **Delete legacy VariantC/D - they are now aliases** (maintenance)
   - VariantC.tsx (294 lines) and VariantD.tsx (271 lines) are now fully superseded by LandingPolymorphic. The index.ts exports them for backward compatibi...
3. **Unify variant duality through themeScheme injection** (maintenance)
   - VariantC, VariantD, and LandingPolymorphic all duplicate the same structural pattern with mode-branching (isDark ternaries). Extract the visual differ...
4. **Improve text contrast in light theme subtitle** (ui)
   - The subtitle text uses text-slate-600 (light theme) which may not meet WCAG AAA contrast requirements against the light background. Measure and upgrad...

**Critical Instructions**:
- DO NOT suggest ideas similar to the pending or accepted ideas listed above
- Focus on finding NEW opportunities not yet covered
- Consider different aspects, layers, or perspectives of the project

## Your Investigation

1.  **Map the Unknowns**: What isn't specified? What relies on assumptions?
2.  **Stress the Boundaries**: What happens at min/max/empty/invalid?
3.  **Trace the Implicit**: Where does code assume rather than verify?
4.  **Identify the Tribal**: What would a new team member misunderstand?

### Champion:
- Explicit over implicit (always)
- Decisions recorded in code or docs, not just made verbally
- Assertions and invariants that make beliefs checkable
- Clear boundaries and contracts between components

### Avoid:
- Asking questions for the sake of seeming thorough
- Demanding perfection in areas where ambiguity is harmless
- Bureaucratic documentation that nobody will read
- Paralysis by analysis

### Expected Output:
Generate 3-5 **CRYSTALLIZING** ideas. Each should turn something fuzzy into something sharp. We want the kind of clarity that prevents bugs, accelerates onboarding, and makes the codebase feel *trustworthy*.


**Clarity Audit**:
The context described above needs illumination.
- What assumptions is this code making?
- What would surprise a new developer here?
- What's the "spec" for this behavior, and where is it documented?
- What decisions haven't been made yet?

## ⚠️ FINAL REMINDER: OUTPUT FORMAT

Your response must be ONLY a JSON array. Here's what your response should look like:

[{"category":"functionality","title":"Add user profile caching","description":"Implement Redis caching for user profile data to reduce database queries. Cache should invalidate on profile updates and have a 5-minute TTL. This will significantly reduce load on the users table.","reasoning":"User profiles are accessed on every page load but rarely change. Caching reduces DB load by ~80% and improves page load times. High impact for minimal implementation effort.","effort":1,"impact":3}]

❌ DO NOT wrap in markdown:
```json
[...]
```

❌ DO NOT add explanations:
Here are the ideas:
[...]

✅ ONLY output the JSON array, nothing else. Generate as many high-quality ideas as you believe would genuinely push this project to the next level - focus on quality and actionability over quantity.


## Project Goals (For Matching Ideas)

Found 3 open goal(s) for this project:

1. **Goal ID**: cf39b596-5e8a-4a53-94df-71ff0056635a
   **Title**: Start from zero
   **Description**: Ability to quickly onboard into the app with clear UX and steps to get into the first chapters. Multi-steps should ensure user can get enough information to decide
- How to pick tech area to start from zero (frontend, games, backend, ...)
- How to pick tech (comparison of market share, learning curve, recommendation based on prior experience)

2. **Goal ID**: 2bbb9cf1-c400-4982-b4a7-e6398b650d9e
   **Title**: Intelligent content
   **Description**: autogenerated content with such quality it can be reusable for others -> Users generate content for everyone basically. First users will create decision for their own paths which generates patterns for others. Other users can follow the pattern or choose another path and build system of courses by their decisions.

Goals
- Solution design
- System of prompts
- DB schema design

3. **Goal ID**: 2ffeb273-c605-49d9-97b9-3d94bb668fd9

   **Description**: Knowledge graphs in this module must be a masterpiece implementation so it can grow and perform with hundreds of nodes on a level
- Design system of levels, there could be multiple levels (area, tech, techniques per difficulty)
- High performance from day one (maybe not render everything at once - google map like scaling of the map)

**Instructions for Goal Matching**:
- For each idea you generate, evaluate if it significantly relates to any of the goals above
- If there is a strong match based on the goal's title and description, include the goal's ID in the "goal_id" field
- If there is no clear match, leave the "goal_id" field empty or omit it
- Only match ideas to goals when there is a clear, meaningful connection

## Saving Ideas to Database

You need to perform TWO steps to save ideas:

### Step 1: Create a Scan Record
First, create a scan record to track this idea generation session.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_ambiguity_guardian",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Ambiguity"
  }'
```

The response will include a `scan.id` - save this for the next step.

### Step 2: Create Ideas
For each idea, make a POST request with this JSON body:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "scan_id": "<scan_id_from_step_1>",
  "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
  "context_id": "ctx_1765875507450_nqddujf",
  "scan_type": "ambiguity_guardian",
  "category": "<category>",
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "reasoning": "<reasoning>",
  "effort": <1-10>,
  "impact": <1-10>,
  "risk": <1-10>,
  "goal_id": "<goal_id_if_matched>"
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always include effort, impact, and risk scores (1-10) for every idea. Do NOT leave these fields empty or null.

### Field Requirements

**category** (string): One of:
- `functionality`: New features, missing capabilities, workflow improvements
- `performance`: Speed, efficiency, memory, database, rendering optimizations
- `maintenance`: Code organization, refactoring, technical debt, testing
- `ui`: Visual design, UX improvements, accessibility, responsiveness
- `code_quality`: Security, error handling, type safety, edge cases
- `user_benefit`: High-level value propositions, business impact, user experience

**title** (string, max 60 chars): Clear, specific, action-oriented title

**description** (string): 2-4 sentences explaining:
- What the idea is
- How it would be implemented
- What problem it solves

**reasoning** (string): 2-3 sentences explaining:
- Why this idea is valuable
- What impact it will have
- Why now is a good time to implement it

**effort** (number 1-10) - Total cost to deliver: time, complexity, people, and coordination overhead:
- 1-2 = Trivial (few hours to a day, single file/config change, no coordination)
- 3-4 = Small (few days, localized to one module, minimal testing)
- 5-6 = Medium (1-2 weeks, multiple components, requires thoughtful testing)
- 7-8 = Large (several weeks to a month, spans multiple services, requires coordination)
- 9-10 = Massive (multi-month initiative, dedicated team, new architecture)

**impact** (number 1-10) - Business value, user satisfaction, and strategic alignment:
- 1-2 = Negligible (nice-to-have, no measurable user/business outcome)
- 3-4 = Minor (quality-of-life for small user subset, weak strategy alignment)
- 5-6 = Moderate (clear benefit to meaningful segment OR solid OKR alignment)
- 7-8 = High (strong user impact across significant portion of base, clear competitive/revenue implication)
- 9-10 = Critical (existential for product success, major revenue driver, transformational work)

**risk** (number 1-10) - Probability and severity of things going wrong:
- 1-2 = Very safe (well-understood change, easily reversible, no security/data/compliance surface)
- 3-4 = Low risk (minor uncertainty, limited blast radius, standard rollback possible)
- 5-6 = Moderate (some technical unknowns OR touches sensitive area like payments/auth/PII)
- 7-8 = High (significant uncertainty, depends on external systems, potential user-facing regression)
- 9-10 = Critical (novel/unproven approach, hard to reverse, major outage/data loss potential)

**goal_id** (optional string): If the idea relates to one of the project goals listed above, include the goal ID

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Create scan record
SCAN_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_ambiguity_guardian",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Ambiguity"
  }')

# Extract scan_id from response
SCAN_ID=$(echo $SCAN_RESPONSE | jq -r '.scan.id')

# Step 2: Create ideas using the scan_id
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scan_id": "'$SCAN_ID'",
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "context_id": "ctx_1765875507450_nqddujf",
    "scan_type": "ambiguity_guardian",
    "category": "functionality",
    "title": "Example: Add user session caching layer",
    "description": "Implement Redis caching for user session data to reduce database queries. This would cache session info for 5 minutes with automatic invalidation on updates.",
    "reasoning": "Currently every page load queries the session table. This adds latency and database load. Caching would reduce DB calls by ~70%.",
    "effort": 5,
    "impact": 7,
    "risk": 4
  }'
```

## Execution Steps

1. Read the project's CLAUDE.md or AI.md documentation if available
2. Explore the codebase structure, focusing on the context files
3. Analyze code with the perspective described in the analysis prompt above
4. Generate high-quality ideas that would genuinely push this project forward (no arbitrary limits - focus on value)
5. Create a scan record via /api/scans
6. Save each idea via /api/ideas using the scan_id
7. Report what ideas were created

## Quality Standards

- **Be Specific**: Reference actual files, components, or patterns you observed
- **Be Actionable**: Ideas should be clear enough to implement without further clarification
- **Be Valuable**: Focus on ideas that bring real improvement, not busywork
- **Match Goals**: If an idea aligns with a project goal, include the goal_id
- **Avoid Duplicates**: Check the existing ideas section and don't suggest similar items

## Output

After completing the task, summarize:
- How many ideas were created
- Brief list of idea titles
- Any observations about the codebase


## Implementation Guidelines

**Steps**:
1. Analyze the requirement thoroughly
2. Identify all files that need to be modified or created
3. Implement all changes specified in the requirement
4. Follow implementation steps precisely
5. Run any tests if specified
6. Ensure all changes are complete before finishing

## File Structure (Next.js/React Projects)

**Feature-Specific Files** (use `app/features/<feature>` structure):
- `app/features/<feature>/components/` - Feature-specific components and UI
- `app/features/<feature>/lib/` - Feature-specific functions, utilities, helpers
- `app/features/<feature>/` - Main wrapper, index, or page file

**Reusable UI Components** (use `app/components/ui` structure):
- `app/components/ui/` - Shared, reusable UI elements across multiple features

## Test Selectors

**CRITICAL**: Add `data-testid` attributes to ALL interactive UI components for automated testing.

**Guidelines**:
- Add to all clickable elements (buttons, links, icons)
- Use descriptive kebab-case: `data-testid="submit-form-btn"`
- Include component context: `data-testid="goal-delete-btn"`, `data-testid="project-settings-modal"`
- Add to form inputs: `data-testid="email-input"`
- Add to list items: `data-testid="task-item-123"`

**Example**:
```tsx
<button onClick={handleSubmit} data-testid="create-goal-btn">
  Create Goal
</button>

<input
  type="text"
  value={title}
  onChange={handleChange}
  data-testid="goal-title-input"
/>
```

## Theming and Styling

**Before creating new UI components**:
1. Examine existing components in the project
2. Match the color scheme, spacing, and visual patterns
3. Use consistent className patterns (Tailwind CSS)
4. Follow the app's design language (glassmorphism, gradients, shadows, etc.)
5. Support dark mode if the app uses it

## Documentation Policy

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT create separate documentation files (.md, README.md, docs/) for routine implementations.

**Only create documentation when**:
- Implementing a NEW major feature or module (not refactorings)
- Adding a NEW API or public interface
- Creating NEW architectural patterns
- The requirement explicitly asks for documentation

**Do NOT create documentation for**:
- Bug fixes
- Refactorings
- Small adjustments
- UI changes
- Database schema changes
- Performance improvements
- Code quality improvements

**For all implementations**: Create an implementation log entry (see next section) - this is your primary documentation.

## Implementation Logging

After completing the implementation, log your work via a simple API call.

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Create separate script files for logging
- ❌ Create SQL scripts or use sqlite3
- ❌ Create documentation files (.md, README.md)

**DO**: Make ONE API call to log your implementation:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/implementation-log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "requirementName": "<requirement-filename-without-.md>",
    "title": "<2-6 word summary>",
    "overview": "<1-2 paragraphs describing implementation>",
    "overviewBullets": "<bullet1>\n<bullet2>\n<bullet3>"
  }'
```

**Field Guidelines**:
- `requirementName`: Requirement filename WITHOUT .md extension
- `title`: 2-6 words (e.g., "User Authentication System")
- `overview`: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
- `overviewBullets`: 3-5 key points separated by \n

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/implementation-log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "proj-123",
    "requirementName": "implement-dark-mode",
    "title": "Dark Mode Implementation",
    "overview": "Implemented global dark mode toggle with theme persistence.",
    "overviewBullets": "Created ThemeProvider\nUpdated components\nAdded toggle in settings"
  }'
```

**If the API call fails**: Report the error and continue - logging failures are non-blocking.
