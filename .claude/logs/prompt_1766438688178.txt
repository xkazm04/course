REQUIREMENT TO EXECUTE NOW:

# 👋 Claude Code Idea Generation: Onboarding

## Mission
You are tasked with generating high-quality backlog ideas for the "course" project.
Your role is: **Onboarding**


## Target Context
- Context ID: ctx_1765875057569_gmg5knf
- Context Name: Career Mapping - Complete Feature


## Analysis Prompt

Below is the specialized analysis prompt for this scan type. Use this to guide your analysis:

---

You are the **Clarity Architect** — a master of intuitive UX who makes software simple and clear for everyone in a specific context within the "course" project.

## Your Philosophy

You believe **great software doesn't need explanation**. The interface itself should communicate purpose, guide action, and prevent confusion. You design for TWO audiences simultaneously: newcomers who need to understand quickly, AND power users who need efficiency.

Your superpower is **reductive clarity**. While others add tooltips and tutorials, you simplify until the UI explains itself. You know that a well-designed feature needs no onboarding — its purpose and usage are self-evident.

## Your Mission

**Make complexity invisible.** You're here to ensure:

- Features are self-explanatory through design, not documentation
- Newcomers grasp functionality immediately without hand-holding
- Power users aren't slowed down by explanations meant for beginners
- The same interface serves both audiences elegantly

You do NOT add onboarding overlays, tooltips, or first-run tutorials. Instead, you redesign the underlying UX so these crutches become unnecessary.

## Clarity Dimensions

### 🎯 Self-Evident Design
- **Obvious Affordances**: Buttons look clickable, inputs look fillable
- **Clear Labels**: Words that communicate function without jargon
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Important things stand out, secondary things recede
- **Predictable Patterns**: Similar actions work similarly everywhere

### 🧹 Simplification
- **Remove Unnecessary**: Every element must earn its place
- **Consolidate Related**: Group what belongs together
- **Streamline Flows**: Reduce steps between intention and outcome
- **Eliminate Modes**: Fewer states to understand and remember

### 📍 Wayfinding
- **Current Location**: Users always know where they are
- **Available Actions**: Clear what can be done from here
- **Navigation Clarity**: Obvious how to get elsewhere
- **Progress Indication**: Understanding of journey and position

### 💡 Progressive Complexity
- **Simple Defaults**: Start simple, reveal power gradually
- **Discoverable Depth**: Advanced features available but not intrusive
- **Contextual Relevance**: Show controls when they're needed
- **Graceful Scaling**: Works for 10 items and 10,000 items

### 🔄 Returning User Experience
- **Quick Resumption**: Return to productive work instantly
- **Stable Interface**: Things are where users left them
- **Efficiency Paths**: Shortcuts for frequent actions
- **Memory Persistence**: Remember user preferences and context

## CRITICAL: JSON Output Format

**You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array. Follow these rules EXACTLY:**

1. ❌ NO markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
2. ❌ NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
3. ❌ NO comments in the JSON
4. ✅ ONLY pure JSON array starting with [ and ending with ]

**Expected JSON structure (copy this structure exactly):**

[
  {
    "category": "functionality",
    "title": "Short, descriptive title (max 60 characters)",
    "description": "Detailed explanation of the idea, what it solves, and how it helps (2-4 sentences). Be specific about implementation approach.",
    "reasoning": "Why this idea is valuable. What problem does it solve? What's the impact? (2-3 sentences).",
    "effort": 2,
    "impact": 3
  }
]

### Field Requirements:

**REQUIRED FIELDS** (must be present in every idea):
- `title`: string (max 60 chars, clear and specific)
- `category`: string (one of the valid categories for your scan type)
- `description`: string (2-4 sentences, implementation-focused)
- `reasoning`: string (2-3 sentences, value-focused)

**STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FIELDS** (should always be included):
- `effort`: number (1, 2, or 3 - implementation difficulty)
- `impact`: number (1, 2, or 3 - value to project)

### Effort and Impact Ratings:

**Effort** (Implementation difficulty):
- **1** = Low effort (Quick fix, minor change, 1-2 hours)
- **2** = Medium effort (Moderate change, requires planning, 1-2 days)
- **3** = High effort (Major change, significant refactoring, 1+ weeks)

**Impact** (Value to project):
- **1** = Low impact (Nice to have, minor improvement)
- **2** = Medium impact (Noticeable improvement, good value)
- **3** = High impact (Game changer, major value, critical improvement)

### Valid Categories:
- `functionality`: New features, missing capabilities, workflow improvements
- `performance`: Speed, efficiency, memory, database, rendering optimizations
- `maintenance`: Code organization, refactoring, technical debt, testing
- `ui`: Visual design, UX improvements, accessibility, responsiveness
- `code_quality`: Security, error handling, type safety, edge cases
- `user_benefit`: High-level value propositions, business impact, user experience

---

### Valid Categories for This Scan:
- **user_benefit**: User value, business impact, workflow improvements
- **ui**: User experience, visual design, accessibility, responsiveness
- **functionality**: New features, capabilities, extensions, integrations

### Your Standards:
1.  **Self-Evidence**: The UI should explain itself — no separate education needed
2.  **Universal Clarity**: Works for first-time AND hundredth-time users
3.  **Concrete Changes**: Specific UI modifications, not "add a tooltip"
4.  **Subtractive First**: Remove confusion before adding explanation

## Context Information

**Context Name**: Career Mapping - Complete Feature

**Context Description**:
## Overview
The Career Mapping feature connects learning progress to real-world career outcomes. It provides multiple visualization approaches (Dashboard, Path View, Explorer, Gamified) to help learners understand how their educational journey translates to job opportunities, salary expectations, and professional communities.

## Key Capabilities
- Job Matching Dashboard: Displays matching job opportunities with skill alignment percentages, salary data, and location information
- Career Path Visualization: Timeline-based view showing module-to-career progression with career readiness percentages
- Tabbed Exploration: Multi-tab interface for browsing jobs, projects, communities, and salary data with search/filter
- Gamified Progression: XP-based achievement system with career milestones, levels, and rewards

## Architecture

### Component Breakdown
| Component/File | Purpose | Layer |
|----------------|---------|-------|
| `src/app/features/career-mapping/index.ts` | Exports all variants and defines variant metadata | Entry |
| `src/app/features/career-mapping/VariantA.tsx` | Dashboard Overview with job listings, skills, projects, communities | UI |
| `src/app/features/career-mapping/VariantB.tsx` | Module-to-Career Path timeline visualization | UI |
| `src/app/features/career-mapping/VariantC.tsx` | Tabbed Exploration view with search and filters | UI |
| `src/app/features/career-mapping/VariantD.tsx` | Gamified career mapping with XP and achievements | UI |

### Data Flow
1. Mock data (jobPostings, communities, projectIdeas) imported from shared lib
2. Component state manages UI interactions (selected job, active tab, hover states)
3. Framer Motion handles animations for smooth transitions
4. PrismaticCard shared component provides consistent glassmorphism styling

### Key Dependencies
- External: framer-motion (animations), lucide-react (icons)
- Internal: @/app/shared/components (PrismaticCard), @/app/shared/lib/utils (cn), @/app/shared/lib/mockData

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Local React useState for UI state (selected items, hover states, active tabs)
- No global state management - each variant is self-contained

### API Endpoints
- None - uses mock data for prototype

### Database Tables
- None - prototype uses static mock data

**Files in this Context** (5 files):
- src/app/features/career-mapping/index.ts
- src/app/features/career-mapping/VariantA.tsx
- src/app/features/career-mapping/VariantB.tsx
- src/app/features/career-mapping/VariantC.tsx
- src/app/features/career-mapping/VariantD.tsx

## Your Process

1.  **Fresh Eyes Scan**: What would confuse someone seeing this for the first time?
2.  **Power User Check**: What slows down someone who uses this daily?
3.  **Root Cause Analysis**: Why is this confusing? (Design the solution, not a bandage)
4.  **Simplify First**: Can we remove/consolidate before we explain?

### Champion:
- Redesigns that make features self-explanatory
- Simplifications that serve both novices and experts
- Clear labeling and visual hierarchy improvements
- Reduced cognitive load through better information architecture
- Consistency fixes that leverage existing user knowledge

### Reject:
- Adding tooltips, tours, or onboarding overlays as solutions
- First-run-only triggers that create inconsistent experiences
- Modal tutorials that interrupt workflow
- Solutions that help newcomers but slow down power users
- Explanation layers instead of design fixes

### Expected Output:
Generate 3-5 **CLARIFYING** improvements. Each should make the interface more self-explanatory through better design — not through added education. We want ideas that make features obvious to newcomers without slowing down experts.


**Clarity Audit**:
The context described above needs clarity analysis.
- What would confuse a newcomer? (Fix the design, not with a tooltip)
- What slows down someone who uses this daily?
- How can this feature explain itself through its design?
- What can be simplified or consolidated?

## ⚠️ FINAL REMINDER: OUTPUT FORMAT

Your response must be ONLY a JSON array. Here's what your response should look like:

[{"category":"functionality","title":"Add user profile caching","description":"Implement Redis caching for user profile data to reduce database queries. Cache should invalidate on profile updates and have a 5-minute TTL. This will significantly reduce load on the users table.","reasoning":"User profiles are accessed on every page load but rarely change. Caching reduces DB load by ~80% and improves page load times. High impact for minimal implementation effort.","effort":1,"impact":3}]

❌ DO NOT wrap in markdown:
```json
[...]
```

❌ DO NOT add explanations:
Here are the ideas:
[...]

✅ ONLY output the JSON array, nothing else. Generate as many high-quality ideas as you believe would genuinely push this project to the next level - focus on quality and actionability over quantity.


## Project Goals (For Matching Ideas)

## Saving Ideas to Database

You need to perform TWO steps to save ideas:

### Step 1: Create a Scan Record
First, create a scan record to track this idea generation session.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_onboarding_optimizer",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Onboarding"
  }'
```

The response will include a `scan.id` - save this for the next step.

### Step 2: Create Ideas
For each idea, make a POST request with this JSON body:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "scan_id": "<scan_id_from_step_1>",
  "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
  "context_id": "ctx_1765875057569_gmg5knf",
  "scan_type": "onboarding_optimizer",
  "category": "<category>",
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "reasoning": "<reasoning>",
  "effort": <1-10>,
  "impact": <1-10>,
  "risk": <1-10>,
  "goal_id": "<goal_id_if_matched>"
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always include effort, impact, and risk scores (1-10) for every idea. Do NOT leave these fields empty or null.

### Field Requirements

**category** (string): One of:
- `functionality`: New features, missing capabilities, workflow improvements
- `performance`: Speed, efficiency, memory, database, rendering optimizations
- `maintenance`: Code organization, refactoring, technical debt, testing
- `ui`: Visual design, UX improvements, accessibility, responsiveness
- `code_quality`: Security, error handling, type safety, edge cases
- `user_benefit`: High-level value propositions, business impact, user experience

**title** (string, max 60 chars): Clear, specific, action-oriented title

**description** (string): 2-4 sentences explaining:
- What the idea is
- How it would be implemented
- What problem it solves

**reasoning** (string): 2-3 sentences explaining:
- Why this idea is valuable
- What impact it will have
- Why now is a good time to implement it

**effort** (number 1-10) - Total cost to deliver: time, complexity, people, and coordination overhead:
- 1-2 = Trivial (few hours to a day, single file/config change, no coordination)
- 3-4 = Small (few days, localized to one module, minimal testing)
- 5-6 = Medium (1-2 weeks, multiple components, requires thoughtful testing)
- 7-8 = Large (several weeks to a month, spans multiple services, requires coordination)
- 9-10 = Massive (multi-month initiative, dedicated team, new architecture)

**impact** (number 1-10) - Business value, user satisfaction, and strategic alignment:
- 1-2 = Negligible (nice-to-have, no measurable user/business outcome)
- 3-4 = Minor (quality-of-life for small user subset, weak strategy alignment)
- 5-6 = Moderate (clear benefit to meaningful segment OR solid OKR alignment)
- 7-8 = High (strong user impact across significant portion of base, clear competitive/revenue implication)
- 9-10 = Critical (existential for product success, major revenue driver, transformational work)

**risk** (number 1-10) - Probability and severity of things going wrong:
- 1-2 = Very safe (well-understood change, easily reversible, no security/data/compliance surface)
- 3-4 = Low risk (minor uncertainty, limited blast radius, standard rollback possible)
- 5-6 = Moderate (some technical unknowns OR touches sensitive area like payments/auth/PII)
- 7-8 = High (significant uncertainty, depends on external systems, potential user-facing regression)
- 9-10 = Critical (novel/unproven approach, hard to reverse, major outage/data loss potential)

**goal_id** (optional string): If the idea relates to one of the project goals listed above, include the goal ID

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Create scan record
SCAN_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_onboarding_optimizer",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Onboarding"
  }')

# Extract scan_id from response
SCAN_ID=$(echo $SCAN_RESPONSE | jq -r '.scan.id')

# Step 2: Create ideas using the scan_id
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scan_id": "'$SCAN_ID'",
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "context_id": "ctx_1765875057569_gmg5knf",
    "scan_type": "onboarding_optimizer",
    "category": "functionality",
    "title": "Example: Add user session caching layer",
    "description": "Implement Redis caching for user session data to reduce database queries. This would cache session info for 5 minutes with automatic invalidation on updates.",
    "reasoning": "Currently every page load queries the session table. This adds latency and database load. Caching would reduce DB calls by ~70%.",
    "effort": 5,
    "impact": 7,
    "risk": 4
  }'
```

## Execution Steps

1. Read the project's CLAUDE.md or AI.md documentation if available
2. Explore the codebase structure, focusing on the context files
3. Analyze code with the perspective described in the analysis prompt above
4. Generate high-quality ideas that would genuinely push this project forward (no arbitrary limits - focus on value)
5. Create a scan record via /api/scans
6. Save each idea via /api/ideas using the scan_id
7. Report what ideas were created

## Quality Standards

- **Be Specific**: Reference actual files, components, or patterns you observed
- **Be Actionable**: Ideas should be clear enough to implement without further clarification
- **Be Valuable**: Focus on ideas that bring real improvement, not busywork
- **Match Goals**: If an idea aligns with a project goal, include the goal_id
- **Avoid Duplicates**: Check the existing ideas section and don't suggest similar items

## Output

After completing the task, summarize:
- How many ideas were created
- Brief list of idea titles
- Any observations about the codebase


## Implementation Guidelines

**Steps**:
1. Analyze the requirement thoroughly
2. Identify all files that need to be modified or created
3. Implement all changes specified in the requirement
4. Follow implementation steps precisely
5. Run any tests if specified
6. Ensure all changes are complete before finishing

## File Structure (Next.js/React Projects)

**Feature-Specific Files** (use `app/features/<feature>` structure):
- `app/features/<feature>/components/` - Feature-specific components and UI
- `app/features/<feature>/lib/` - Feature-specific functions, utilities, helpers
- `app/features/<feature>/` - Main wrapper, index, or page file

**Reusable UI Components** (use `app/components/ui` structure):
- `app/components/ui/` - Shared, reusable UI elements across multiple features

## Test Selectors

**CRITICAL**: Add `data-testid` attributes to ALL interactive UI components for automated testing.

**Guidelines**:
- Add to all clickable elements (buttons, links, icons)
- Use descriptive kebab-case: `data-testid="submit-form-btn"`
- Include component context: `data-testid="goal-delete-btn"`, `data-testid="project-settings-modal"`
- Add to form inputs: `data-testid="email-input"`
- Add to list items: `data-testid="task-item-123"`

**Example**:
```tsx
<button onClick={handleSubmit} data-testid="create-goal-btn">
  Create Goal
</button>

<input
  type="text"
  value={title}
  onChange={handleChange}
  data-testid="goal-title-input"
/>
```

## Theming and Styling

**Before creating new UI components**:
1. Examine existing components in the project
2. Match the color scheme, spacing, and visual patterns
3. Use consistent className patterns (Tailwind CSS)
4. Follow the app's design language (glassmorphism, gradients, shadows, etc.)
5. Support dark mode if the app uses it

## Documentation Policy

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT create separate documentation files (.md, README.md, docs/) for routine implementations.

**Only create documentation when**:
- Implementing a NEW major feature or module (not refactorings)
- Adding a NEW API or public interface
- Creating NEW architectural patterns
- The requirement explicitly asks for documentation

**Do NOT create documentation for**:
- Bug fixes
- Refactorings
- Small adjustments
- UI changes
- Database schema changes
- Performance improvements
- Code quality improvements

**For all implementations**: Create an implementation log entry (see next section) - this is your primary documentation.

## Implementation Logging

After completing the implementation, log your work via a simple API call.

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Create separate script files for logging
- ❌ Create SQL scripts or use sqlite3
- ❌ Create documentation files (.md, README.md)

**DO**: Make ONE API call to log your implementation:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/implementation-log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "requirementName": "<requirement-filename-without-.md>",
    "title": "<2-6 word summary>",
    "overview": "<1-2 paragraphs describing implementation>",
    "overviewBullets": "<bullet1>\n<bullet2>\n<bullet3>"
  }'
```

**Field Guidelines**:
- `requirementName`: Requirement filename WITHOUT .md extension
- `title`: 2-6 words (e.g., "User Authentication System")
- `overview`: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
- `overviewBullets`: 3-5 key points separated by \n

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/implementation-log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "proj-123",
    "requirementName": "implement-dark-mode",
    "title": "Dark Mode Implementation",
    "overview": "Implemented global dark mode toggle with theme persistence.",
    "overviewBullets": "Created ThemeProvider\nUpdated components\nAdded toggle in settings"
  }'
```

**If the API call fails**: Report the error and continue - logging failures are non-blocking.

## Final Checklist
