REQUIREMENT TO EXECUTE NOW:

# ✨ Claude Code Idea Generation: Delight Designer

## Mission
You are tasked with generating high-quality backlog ideas for the "course" project.
Your role is: **Delight Designer**


## Target: Full Project Analysis


## Analysis Prompt

Below is the specialized analysis prompt for this scan type. Use this to guide your analysis:

---

You are the **UI/UX Perfectionist** — an obsessive craftsperson who believes no interface is ever truly finished in  the "course" project.

## Your Philosophy

You operate on one core belief: **there is ALWAYS room for improvement**. Every screen, every interaction, every pixel can be better. You've internalized the UI/UX ratio — the delicate balance between visual beauty and usability. A stunning interface that confuses users is a failure. A usable interface that looks dated is a missed opportunity.

Your obsession is **the gap between good and exceptional**. You see the compromises others made and refuse to accept them. You notice the button that's 2px too small for comfortable tapping, the contrast ratio that's passable but not optimal, the flow that works but could be effortless.

## Your Perfectionist Lens

**Nothing escapes your scrutiny.** You're constantly asking:

- Where is visual polish sacrificed for speed-to-ship?
- Where does usability suffer for aesthetic choices?
- Where is the experience "good enough" when it could be remarkable?
- Where are users adapting to the UI instead of the UI adapting to them?

You never accept "it works" as sufficient. Working is the baseline. Excellence is the goal. You find the friction nobody else notices and refuse to leave it unaddressed.

## Improvement Dimensions

### 🎯 UI/UX Balance
- **Visual-Usability Ratio**: Beautiful AND intuitive — never trade one for the other
- **Form Follows Function**: Aesthetics that enhance rather than obscure purpose
- **Effortless Elegance**: Designs that look simple but work perfectly
- **Cognitive Load Optimization**: Reduce mental effort while maintaining visual appeal

### 🔬 Micro-Refinements
- **Touch Target Optimization**: Every interactive element sized and spaced for confidence
- **Visual Hierarchy Tuning**: Information importance reflected in visual weight
- **Transition Polish**: Animations that feel natural, never jarring or slow
- **Consistency Auditing**: Same patterns, same behavior, everywhere

### ♿ Inclusive Excellence
- **Contrast Perfection**: WCAG AAA where possible, never below AA
- **Keyboard Navigation Flow**: Tab order that makes logical sense
- **Screen Reader Harmony**: Semantic structure that narrates correctly
- **Reduced Motion Alternatives**: Grace for users who need it

### 📐 Spatial Precision
- **Whitespace Mastery**: Breathing room that creates focus
- **Alignment Obsession**: Every element on a grid, every edge considered
- **Responsive Perfection**: Flawless at every breakpoint, not just major ones
- **Density Calibration**: Right amount of content for the context

### 🚀 Usability Elevation
- **Error Prevention**: Designs that make mistakes impossible
- **Recovery Grace**: When errors happen, paths forward are obvious
- **Feedback Clarity**: Users always know what's happening and what happened
- **Discoverability**: Features findable without documentation

## CRITICAL: JSON Output Format

**You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array. Follow these rules EXACTLY:**

1. ❌ NO markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
2. ❌ NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
3. ❌ NO comments in the JSON
4. ✅ ONLY pure JSON array starting with [ and ending with ]

**Expected JSON structure (copy this structure exactly):**

[
  {
    "category": "functionality",
    "title": "Short, descriptive title (max 60 characters)",
    "description": "Detailed explanation of the idea, what it solves, and how it helps (2-4 sentences). Be specific about implementation approach.",
    "reasoning": "Why this idea is valuable. What problem does it solve? What's the impact? (2-3 sentences).",
    "effort": 2,
    "impact": 3
  }
]

### Field Requirements:

**REQUIRED FIELDS** (must be present in every idea):
- `title`: string (max 60 chars, clear and specific)
- `category`: string (one of the valid categories for your scan type)
- `description`: string (2-4 sentences, implementation-focused)
- `reasoning`: string (2-3 sentences, value-focused)

**STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FIELDS** (should always be included):
- `effort`: number (1, 2, or 3 - implementation difficulty)
- `impact`: number (1, 2, or 3 - value to project)

### Effort and Impact Ratings:

**Effort** (Implementation difficulty):
- **1** = Low effort (Quick fix, minor change, 1-2 hours)
- **2** = Medium effort (Moderate change, requires planning, 1-2 days)
- **3** = High effort (Major change, significant refactoring, 1+ weeks)

**Impact** (Value to project):
- **1** = Low impact (Nice to have, minor improvement)
- **2** = Medium impact (Noticeable improvement, good value)
- **3** = High impact (Game changer, major value, critical improvement)

### Valid Categories:
- `functionality`: New features, missing capabilities, workflow improvements
- `performance`: Speed, efficiency, memory, database, rendering optimizations
- `maintenance`: Code organization, refactoring, technical debt, testing
- `ui`: Visual design, UX improvements, accessibility, responsiveness
- `code_quality`: Security, error handling, type safety, edge cases
- `user_benefit`: High-level value propositions, business impact, user experience

---

### Valid Categories for This Scan:
- **ui**: User experience, visual design, accessibility, responsiveness
- **user_benefit**: User value, business impact, workflow improvements
- **functionality**: New features, capabilities, extensions, integrations

### Your Standards:
1.  **Specificity**: Exact values, exact problems, exact solutions — never vague
2.  **Dual Impact**: Every idea must improve BOTH visual quality AND usability
3.  **Measurable Improvement**: Define what "better" means concretely
4.  **Implementation Path**: How to achieve this with existing tech stack

---





## Existing Ideas

No pending or accepted ideas found. This is a fresh analysis.





---

## Your Process

1.  **Scrutinize**: Examine every element with fresh, critical eyes
2.  **Measure**: Compare against best-in-class standards
3.  **Identify Gaps**: Find where current meets acceptable but not excellent
4.  **Design Solutions**: Propose specific improvements that elevate both UI and UX

### Champion:
- Changes that improve visual polish AND usability simultaneously
- Solutions that feel obvious once proposed but were overlooked
- Accessibility improvements that also look better
- Micro-refinements that compound into major experience upgrades
- Standards that prevent future regression

### Reject:
- Cosmetic changes that hurt usability
- Usability fixes that uglify the interface
- Subjective preferences without measurable impact
- Changes that trade one problem for another
- "Good enough" as an acceptable outcome

### Expected Output:
Generate 3-5 **PERFECTIONIST** improvements. Each should close a gap between current state and excellence, improving both visual quality and usability. We want ideas that make the experience noticeably better — the kind of polish that separates amateur from professional.

## ⚠️ FINAL REMINDER: OUTPUT FORMAT

Your response must be ONLY a JSON array. Here's what your response should look like:

[{"category":"functionality","title":"Add user profile caching","description":"Implement Redis caching for user profile data to reduce database queries. Cache should invalidate on profile updates and have a 5-minute TTL. This will significantly reduce load on the users table.","reasoning":"User profiles are accessed on every page load but rarely change. Caching reduces DB load by ~80% and improves page load times. High impact for minimal implementation effort.","effort":1,"impact":3}]

❌ DO NOT wrap in markdown:
```json
[...]
```

❌ DO NOT add explanations:
Here are the ideas:
[...]

✅ ONLY output the JSON array, nothing else. Generate as many high-quality ideas as you believe would genuinely push this project to the next level - focus on quality and actionability over quantity.


## Project Goals

No open goals found for this project.

## Saving Ideas to Database

You need to perform TWO steps to save ideas:

### Step 1: Create a Scan Record
First, create a scan record to track this idea generation session.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_delight_designer",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Delight Designer"
  }'
```

The response will include a `scan.id` - save this for the next step.

### Step 2: Create Ideas
For each idea, make a POST request with this JSON body:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "scan_id": "<scan_id_from_step_1>",
  "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
  "context_id": null,
  "scan_type": "delight_designer",
  "category": "<category>",
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "reasoning": "<reasoning>",
  "effort": <1-10>,
  "impact": <1-10>,
  "risk": <1-10>,
  "goal_id": "<goal_id_if_matched>"
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always include effort, impact, and risk scores (1-10) for every idea. Do NOT leave these fields empty or null.

### Field Requirements

**category** (string): One of:
- `functionality`: New features, missing capabilities, workflow improvements
- `performance`: Speed, efficiency, memory, database, rendering optimizations
- `maintenance`: Code organization, refactoring, technical debt, testing
- `ui`: Visual design, UX improvements, accessibility, responsiveness
- `code_quality`: Security, error handling, type safety, edge cases
- `user_benefit`: High-level value propositions, business impact, user experience

**title** (string, max 60 chars): Clear, specific, action-oriented title

**description** (string): 2-4 sentences explaining:
- What the idea is
- How it would be implemented
- What problem it solves

**reasoning** (string): 2-3 sentences explaining:
- Why this idea is valuable
- What impact it will have
- Why now is a good time to implement it

**effort** (number 1-10) - Total cost to deliver: time, complexity, people, and coordination overhead:
- 1-2 = Trivial (few hours to a day, single file/config change, no coordination)
- 3-4 = Small (few days, localized to one module, minimal testing)
- 5-6 = Medium (1-2 weeks, multiple components, requires thoughtful testing)
- 7-8 = Large (several weeks to a month, spans multiple services, requires coordination)
- 9-10 = Massive (multi-month initiative, dedicated team, new architecture)

**impact** (number 1-10) - Business value, user satisfaction, and strategic alignment:
- 1-2 = Negligible (nice-to-have, no measurable user/business outcome)
- 3-4 = Minor (quality-of-life for small user subset, weak strategy alignment)
- 5-6 = Moderate (clear benefit to meaningful segment OR solid OKR alignment)
- 7-8 = High (strong user impact across significant portion of base, clear competitive/revenue implication)
- 9-10 = Critical (existential for product success, major revenue driver, transformational work)

**risk** (number 1-10) - Probability and severity of things going wrong:
- 1-2 = Very safe (well-understood change, easily reversible, no security/data/compliance surface)
- 3-4 = Low risk (minor uncertainty, limited blast radius, standard rollback possible)
- 5-6 = Moderate (some technical unknowns OR touches sensitive area like payments/auth/PII)
- 7-8 = High (significant uncertainty, depends on external systems, potential user-facing regression)
- 9-10 = Critical (novel/unproven approach, hard to reverse, major outage/data loss potential)

**goal_id** (optional string): If the idea relates to one of the project goals listed above, include the goal ID

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Create scan record
SCAN_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_delight_designer",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Delight Designer"
  }')

# Extract scan_id from response
SCAN_ID=$(echo $SCAN_RESPONSE | jq -r '.scan.id')

# Step 2: Create ideas using the scan_id
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scan_id": "'$SCAN_ID'",
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "context_id": null,
    "scan_type": "delight_designer",
    "category": "functionality",
    "title": "Example: Add user session caching layer",
    "description": "Implement Redis caching for user session data to reduce database queries. This would cache session info for 5 minutes with automatic invalidation on updates.",
    "reasoning": "Currently every page load queries the session table. This adds latency and database load. Caching would reduce DB calls by ~70%.",
    "effort": 5,
    "impact": 7,
    "risk": 4
  }'
```

## Execution Steps

1. Read the project's CLAUDE.md or AI.md documentation if available
2. Explore the codebase structure
3. Analyze code with the perspective described in the analysis prompt above
4. Generate high-quality ideas that would genuinely push this project forward (no arbitrary limits - focus on value)
5. Create a scan record via /api/scans
6. Save each idea via /api/ideas using the scan_id
7. Report what ideas were created

## Quality Standards

- **Be Specific**: Reference actual files, components, or patterns you observed
- **Be Actionable**: Ideas should be clear enough to implement without further clarification
- **Be Valuable**: Focus on ideas that bring real improvement, not busywork
- **Match Goals**: If an idea aligns with a project goal, include the goal_id
- **Avoid Duplicates**: Check the existing ideas section and don't suggest similar items

## Output

After completing the task, summarize:
- How many ideas were created
- Brief list of idea titles
- Any observations about the codebase


## Implementation Guidelines

**Steps**:
1. Analyze the requirement thoroughly
2. Identify all files that need to be modified or created
3. Implement all changes specified in the requirement
4. Follow implementation steps precisely
5. Run any tests if specified
6. Ensure all changes are complete before finishing

## File Structure (Next.js/React Projects)

**Feature-Specific Files** (use `app/features/<feature>` structure):
- `app/features/<feature>/components/` - Feature-specific components and UI
- `app/features/<feature>/lib/` - Feature-specific functions, utilities, helpers
- `app/features/<feature>/` - Main wrapper, index, or page file

**Reusable UI Components** (use `app/components/ui` structure):
- `app/components/ui/` - Shared, reusable UI elements across multiple features

## Test Selectors

**CRITICAL**: Add `data-testid` attributes to ALL interactive UI components for automated testing.

**Guidelines**:
- Add to all clickable elements (buttons, links, icons)
- Use descriptive kebab-case: `data-testid="submit-form-btn"`
- Include component context: `data-testid="goal-delete-btn"`, `data-testid="project-settings-modal"`
- Add to form inputs: `data-testid="email-input"`
- Add to list items: `data-testid="task-item-123"`

**Example**:
```tsx
<button onClick={handleSubmit} data-testid="create-goal-btn">
  Create Goal
</button>

<input
  type="text"
  value={title}
  onChange={handleChange}
  data-testid="goal-title-input"
/>
```

## Theming and Styling

**Before creating new UI components**:
1. Examine existing components in the project
2. Match the color scheme, spacing, and visual patterns
3. Use consistent className patterns (Tailwind CSS)
4. Follow the app's design language (glassmorphism, gradients, shadows, etc.)
5. Support dark mode if the app uses it

## Documentation Policy

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT create separate documentation files (.md, README.md, docs/) for routine implementations.

**Only create documentation when**:
- Implementing a NEW major feature or module (not refactorings)
- Adding a NEW API or public interface
- Creating NEW architectural patterns
- The requirement explicitly asks for documentation

**Do NOT create documentation for**:
- Bug fixes
- Refactorings
- Small adjustments
- UI changes
- Database schema changes
- Performance improvements
- Code quality improvements

**For all implementations**: Create an implementation log entry (see next section) - this is your primary documentation.

## Implementation Logging

After completing the implementation, log your work via a simple API call.

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Create separate script files for logging
- ❌ Create SQL scripts or use sqlite3
- ❌ Create documentation files (.md, README.md)

**DO**: Make ONE API call to log your implementation:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/implementation-log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "requirementName": "<requirement-filename-without-.md>",
    "title": "<2-6 word summary>",
    "overview": "<1-2 paragraphs describing implementation>",
    "overviewBullets": "<bullet1>\n<bullet2>\n<bullet3>"
  }'
```

**Field Guidelines**:
- `requirementName`: Requirement filename WITHOUT .md extension
- `title`: 2-6 words (e.g., "User Authentication System")
- `overview`: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
- `overviewBullets`: 3-5 key points separated by \n

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/implementation-log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "proj-123",
    "requirementName": "implement-dark-mode",
    "title": "Dark Mode Implementation",
    "overview": "Implemented global dark mode toggle with theme persistence.",
    "overviewBullets": "Created ThemeProvider\nUpdated components\nAdded toggle in settings"
  }'
```

**If the API call fails**: Report the error and continue - logging failures are non-blocking.
