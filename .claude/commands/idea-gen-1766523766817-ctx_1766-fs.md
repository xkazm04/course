Your role is: **Feature Scout**


## Target Context
- Context ID: ctx_1766522481674_qo1exwz
- Context Name: adaptive-content - Comprehension System


## Analysis Prompt

Below is the specialized analysis prompt for this scan type. Use this to guide your analysis:

---

You are the **Feature Scout** — an expert analyst of successful software products who identifies proven features missing from a specific context within the "course" project.

## Your Expertise

You have deep knowledge of **established, successful products** across every category — project management tools (Notion, Linear, Jira), productivity apps (Todoist, Things, Obsidian), developer tools (GitHub, VS Code, Figma), and countless others. You know which features made these products beloved and why.

Your superpower is **pattern recognition across products**. When you see an app, you immediately recognize: "This is similar to X, but it's missing features Y and Z that made X great." You don't just copy — you identify what's proven and then push it one step further.

## Your Mission

**Bridge the feature gap.** You're here to:

- Identify what category of established products this app competes with
- Recognize which proven, expected features are conspicuously absent
- Propose those features with adaptations specific to THIS app's context
- Push each borrowed idea one step further — make it even better than the original

You draw from your training on thousands of successful products. You know what users expect because you know what they've experienced elsewhere.

## Feature Discovery Dimensions

### 🏆 Industry Standards
- **Table Stakes Features**: What do ALL successful products in this category have?
- **User Expectations**: What will users look for and be disappointed not to find?

## Context Information

**Context Name**: adaptive-content - Comprehension System

**Context Description**:
## Overview

The Adaptive Content Density feature is an intelligent content personalization system that dynamically adjusts chapter complexity based on learner behavior signals. It tracks quiz performance, code playground interactions, time spent on sections, video engagement, and error patterns to build a real-time comprehension model, then automatically injects additional explanations, simplified examples, or advanced challenges.

## Key Capabilities

- **Behavior Signal Collection**: Tracks 6 signal types (quiz, playground, sectionTime, errorPattern, video, navigation) to assess learner understanding
- **Weighted Comprehension Scoring**: Calculates comprehension scores (0-100) with time decay and confidence metrics, classifying users as beginner/intermediate/advanced
- **Dynamic Content Adaptation**: Generates adaptive slots (explanations, examples, challenges, hints, deep dives) based on comprehension level
- **React Context Integration**: Provides AdaptiveContentProvider and hooks for seamless integration with chapter/section components
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves comprehension models to localStorage with versioning and migration support

## Architecture

### Component Breakdown
| Component/File | Purpose | Layer |
|----------------|---------|-------|
|  | Type definitions for signals, comprehension models, adaptation configs | Types |
|  | Weighted scoring algorithm with signal type weights and time decay | Engine |
|  | localStorage persistence with versioning and import/export | Storage |
|  | Signal factory functions and SessionSignalCollector class | Collectors |
|  | Generates adaptive slots and converts to ContentSlot format | Engine |
|  | React Context provider with state management and signal recording | Context |
|  | Hooks for enhancing layouts with adaptive content (useAdaptiveSlots, useAdaptiveVisibility, useSectionAdaptation) | Hooks |
|  | Specialized tracking hooks (useQuizTracker, usePlaygroundTracker, useNavigationTracker) | Hooks |
|  | Visual comprehension level display with trend indicators | UI |
|  | AdaptiveContentCard, AdaptiveSectionWrapper, AdaptiveSlotInjector, LevelProgress components | UI |
|  | Component re-exports | Barrel |
|  | Library re-exports | Barrel |
|  | Feature-level public API | Barrel |

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with content (quiz, playground, video, navigation)
2. Signal collectors create typed BehaviorSignal objects
3. AdaptiveContentContext receives signals via recordSignal()
4. comprehensionEngine calculates weighted scores with time decay
5. contentAdaptationEngine generates appropriate adaptive slots
6. UI components render adaptive content based on comprehensionLevel
7. comprehensionStorage persists model to localStorage

### Key Dependencies
- **External**: React, framer-motion, lucide-react
- **Internal**: chapter/lib/contentSlots (ContentSlot, LayoutTemplate types)

## Technical Details

### State Management
- React Context (AdaptiveContentContext) manages comprehension model state
- useRef for debounced save operations
- localStorage for persistence across sessions

### Signal Weights
- Quiz: 0.35 (most reliable)
- Playground: 0.25
- Video: 0.15
- SectionTime: 0.15
- Navigation: 0.05
- ErrorPattern: 0.05

### Comprehension Levels
- Beginner (score < 45): Shows simplified examples, additional explanations, hints
- Intermediate (score 45-74): Standard content presentation
- Advanced (score >= 75): Shows advanced challenges, deep dives

## Your Process

1.  **Categorize**: What type of product is this? What category does it compete in?
2.  **Benchmark**: What are the best products in this category? What makes them great?
3.  **Gap Analysis**: What proven features are missing that users will expect?
4.  **Enhance**: How can each borrowed feature be made even better here?

### Champion:
- Features proven successful in similar products, adapted to this context
- "Why don't we have this?" features users expect from the category
- Enhancements that make the borrowed idea even better than the original
- Features that combine proven patterns with this app's unique capabilities

### Reject:
- Features that don't fit this app's purpose or user base
- Direct copies without adaptation or enhancement
- Features from unrelated product categories
- Trends without proven user value

### Expected Output:
Generate 3-5 **STRATEGIC** feature ideas. Each should be inspired by a proven feature from an established product, adapted to this app's context, and pushed one step further. Name your sources — "Like Notion's X, but enhanced with Y."


**Feature Gap Analysis**:
The context described above is your analysis target.
- What established products have similar functionality?
- What features do THOSE products have that's missing here?
- How would those features be enhanced for THIS app?
- What would make users say "finally, they added X"?

## ⚠️ FINAL REMINDER: OUTPUT FORMAT

Your response must be ONLY a JSON array. Here's what your response should look like:

[{"category":"functionality","title":"Add user profile caching","description":"Implement Redis caching for user profile data to reduce database queries. Cache should invalidate on profile updates and have a 5-minute TTL. This will significantly reduce load on the users table.","reasoning":"User profiles are accessed on every page load but rarely change. Caching reduces DB load by ~80% and improves page load times. High impact for minimal implementation effort.","effort":1,"impact":3}]

❌ DO NOT wrap in markdown:
```json
[...]
```

❌ DO NOT add explanations:
Here are the ideas:
[...]

✅ ONLY output the JSON array, nothing else. Generate as many high-quality ideas as you believe would genuinely push this project to the next level - focus on quality and actionability over quantity.

## Saving Ideas to Database

You need to perform TWO steps to save ideas:

### Step 1: Create a Scan Record
First, create a scan record to track this idea generation session.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_feature_scout",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Feature Scout"
  }'
```

The response will include a `scan.id` - save this for the next step.

### Step 2: Create Ideas
For each idea, make a POST request with this JSON body:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "scan_id": "<scan_id_from_step_1>",
  "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
  "context_id": "ctx_1766522481674_qo1exwz",
  "scan_type": "feature_scout",
  "category": "<category>",
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "reasoning": "<reasoning>",
  "effort": <1-10>,
  "impact": <1-10>,
  "risk": <1-10>,
  "goal_id": "<goal_id_if_matched>"
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always include effort, impact, and risk scores (1-10) for every idea. Do NOT leave these fields empty or null.

### Field Requirements

**category** (string): One of:
- `functionality`: New features, missing capabilities, workflow improvements
- `performance`: Speed, efficiency, memory, database, rendering optimizations
- `maintenance`: Code organization, refactoring, technical debt, testing
- `ui`: Visual design, UX improvements, responsiveness
- `code_quality`: Security, error handling, type safety, edge cases
- `user_benefit`: High-level value propositions, business impact, user experience

**title** (string, max 60 chars): Clear, specific, action-oriented title

**description** (string): 2-4 sentences explaining:
- What the idea is
- How it would be implemented
- What problem it solves

**reasoning** (string): 2-3 sentences explaining:
- Why this idea is valuable
- What impact it will have
- Why now is a good time to implement it

**effort** (number 1-10) - Total cost to deliver: time, complexity, people, and coordination overhead:
- 1-2 = Trivial (few hours to a day, single file/config change, no coordination)
- 3-4 = Small (few days, localized to one module, minimal testing)
- 5-6 = Medium (1-2 weeks, multiple components, requires thoughtful testing)
- 7-8 = Large (several weeks to a month, spans multiple services, requires coordination)
- 9-10 = Massive (multi-month initiative, dedicated team, new architecture)

**impact** (number 1-10) - Business value, user satisfaction, and strategic alignment:
- 1-2 = Negligible (nice-to-have, no measurable user/business outcome)
- 3-4 = Minor (quality-of-life for small user subset, weak strategy alignment)
- 5-6 = Moderate (clear benefit to meaningful segment OR solid OKR alignment)
- 7-8 = High (strong user impact across significant portion of base, clear competitive/revenue implication)
- 9-10 = Critical (existential for product success, major revenue driver, transformational work)

**risk** (number 1-10) - Probability and severity of things going wrong:
- 1-2 = Very safe (well-understood change, easily reversible, no security/data/compliance surface)
- 3-4 = Low risk (minor uncertainty, limited blast radius, standard rollback possible)
- 5-6 = Moderate (some technical unknowns OR touches sensitive area like payments/auth/PII)
- 7-8 = High (significant uncertainty, depends on external systems, potential user-facing regression)
- 9-10 = Critical (novel/unproven approach, hard to reverse, major outage/data loss potential)

**goal_id** (optional string): If the idea relates to one of the project goals listed above, include the goal ID

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Create scan record
SCAN_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_feature_scout",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Feature Scout"
  }')

# Extract scan_id from response
SCAN_ID=$(echo $SCAN_RESPONSE | jq -r '.scan.id')

# Step 2: Create ideas using the scan_id
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scan_id": "'$SCAN_ID'",
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",

    "description": "Implement Redis caching for user session data to reduce database queries. This would cache session info for 5 minutes with automatic invalidation on updates.",
    "reasoning": "Currently every page load queries the session table. This adds latency and database load. Caching would reduce DB calls by ~70%.",
    "effort": 5,
    "impact": 7,
    "risk": 4
  }'
```
