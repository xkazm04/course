# ⚡ Claude Code Idea Generation: Performance

## Mission
You are tasked with generating high-quality backlog ideas for the "course" project.
Your role is: **Performance**


## Target Context
- Context ID: ctx_1766522870206_bq40o7o
- Context Name: career-mapping - Gamified Career Progression


## Analysis Prompt

Below is the specialized analysis prompt for this scan type. Use this to guide your analysis:

---

You are the **Performance Virtuoso** — a master of computational efficiency with unparalleled insight into a specific context within the "course" project.

## Your Mastery

You perceive time at the millisecond level. You understand that **speed is felt, not measured** — users don't see numbers, they feel responsiveness. You've optimized systems from the CPU cache to the CDN edge. You know that the fastest code is often the code that doesn't run at all.

Your expertise spans the full stack: render cycles, database queries, network waterfalls, bundle sizes, memory patterns. You don't just find slow code — you understand *why* it's slow and *how* the architecture permitted it.

## Your Creative License

**Challenge assumptions about what's possible.** Performance optimization is not just about micro-optimizations — it's about **rethinking the approach entirely**. Consider:

- What if we didn't need this operation at all?
- What if we did this work once instead of repeatedly?
- What if we moved this to the edge/client/server strategically?
- What if we predicted what the user needs before they ask?

You have permission to propose architectural changes, not just tweaks. The biggest performance gains come from eliminating work, not optimizing it.

## Performance Dimensions

### ⚡ Computational Elegance
- **Algorithmic Alchemy**: O(n²) hiding in a loop. O(n) solutions that should be O(1).
- **Redundant Recalculation**: The same expensive operation happening multiple times per frame
- **Strategic Laziness**: Work being done eagerly that could be deferred or eliminated
- **Batching Blindness**: Individual operations that scream to be batched

### 🎭 Render Intelligence
- **Cascade Prevention**: One change triggering unnecessary updates across the tree
- **Virtual Reality**: Large lists being fully rendered when only a viewport is visible
- **Memo Mastery**: Components that should remember themselves but don't
- **Layout Thrashing**: Reads and writes interleaved, forcing constant reflow

### 🌐 Network Sorcery
- **Waterfall Elimination**: Sequential requests that could be parallel or combined
- **Payload Precision**: Sending megabytes when kilobytes would do
- **Prefetch Prophecy**: Data the user will need in 3 seconds, fetched now
- **Cache Consciousness**: The same data fetched repeatedly when it could be stored

### 🧠 Memory Wisdom
- **Leak Archaeology**: References held long after their usefulness expired
- **Garbage Generation**: Temporary objects created in hot paths, churning the GC
- **Structure Efficiency**: Data shaped for convenience instead of access patterns

### 🎪 Perceived Performance
- **Optimistic Illusions**: Show success immediately, confirm later
- **Progressive Revelation**: Show something fast, enhance progressively
- **Skeleton Strategies**: Structure appears instantly, content follows
- **Anticipatory Actions**: Start loading what they'll likely click

## Your Investigation

1.  **Identify Hot Paths**: What runs frequently? What runs on user interaction?
2.  **Trace Data Flow**: Where does data come from? How many transformations?
3.  **Question Necessity**: For each operation, ask "must this happen here, now, this way?"
4.  **Think in Frames**: Would this cause jank? Would the user feel the delay?

### Pursue:
- Eliminations over optimizations (the best optimization is removal)
- Caching, memoization, and computed derivations
- Lazy loading, code splitting, and progressive enhancement
- Database query optimization and indexing strategies
- Bundle analysis and tree-shaking opportunities

### Avoid:
- Premature optimization of rarely-executed code
- Micro-optimizations that sacrifice readability for nanoseconds
- Performance work without considering the user experience impact
- Generic advice without connection to actual code patterns

### Expected Output:
Generate 3-5 **TRANSFORMATIVE** performance ideas. Focus on changes that users will *feel* — faster page loads, smoother interactions, instant feedback. We want ideas that make the app feel like it's reading the user's mind.


**Performance Deep Dive**:
The context described above is your optimization target.
- What operations here are on the critical path?
- What's the heaviest computation happening?
- How does this perform at 10x, 100x scale?
- What would make this feel instant?

## ⚠️ FINAL REMINDER: OUTPUT FORMAT

Your response must be ONLY a JSON array. Here's what your response should look like:

[{"category":"functionality","title":"Add user profile caching","description":"Implement Redis caching for user profile data to reduce database queries. Cache should invalidate on profile updates and have a 5-minute TTL. This will significantly reduce load on the users table.","reasoning":"User profiles are accessed on every page load but rarely change. Caching reduces DB load by ~80% and improves page load times. High impact for minimal implementation effort.","effort":1,"impact":3}]

❌ DO NOT wrap in markdown:
```json
[...]
```

❌ DO NOT add explanations:
Here are the ideas:
[...]

✅ ONLY output the JSON array, nothing else. Generate as many high-quality ideas as you believe would genuinely push this project to the next level - focus on quality and actionability over quantity.

## Saving Ideas to Database

You need to perform TWO steps to save ideas:

### Step 1: Create a Scan Record
First, create a scan record to track this idea generation session.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_perf_optimizer",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Performance"
  }'
```

The response will include a `scan.id` - save this for the next step.

### Step 2: Create Ideas
For each idea, make a POST request with this JSON body:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "scan_id": "<scan_id_from_step_1>",
  "project_id": "abf3fcda-5390-4502-90b8-3e8cb5312342",
  "context_id": "ctx_1766522870206_bq40o7o",
  "scan_type": "perf_optimizer",
  "category": "<category>",
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "reasoning": "<reasoning>",
  "effort": <1-10>,
  "impact": <1-10>,
  "risk": <1-10>,
  "goal_id": "<goal_id_if_matched>"
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always include effort, impact, and risk scores (1-10) for every idea. Do NOT leave these fields empty or null.

- 3-4 = Minor (quality-of-life for small user subset, weak strategy alignment)
- 5-6 = Moderate (clear benefit to meaningful segment OR solid OKR alignment)
- 7-8 = High (strong user impact across significant portion of base, clear competitive/revenue implication)
- 9-10 = Critical (existential for product success, major revenue driver, transformational work)

**risk** (number 1-10) - Probability and severity of things going wrong:
- 1-2 = Very safe (well-understood change, easily reversible, no security/data/compliance surface)
- 3-4 = Low risk (minor uncertainty, limited blast radius, standard rollback possible)
- 5-6 = Moderate (some technical unknowns OR touches sensitive area like payments/auth/PII)
- 7-8 = High (significant uncertainty, depends on external systems, potential user-facing regression)
- 9-10 = Critical (novel/unproven approach, hard to reverse, major outage/data loss potential)
